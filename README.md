# WebSite johnosproject.com

Repository for johnosproject.com website.

This repo contains the landing website for the John OS Project. It is based on
simple html/css files. Those files are generated using the [GrapesJS Studio](https://studio.grapesjs.com/).

## Development

Open the [GrapesJS Studio](https://studio.grapesjs.com/) and load the `gis-project.grapesjs`.
Click on the Gear icon in the top-right corner and select the `Open project` option.
Then, into the showed dialog, select the `gis-project.grapesjs` file.

Now you can edit the pages and their content.

When you finish, click on the `Code` button and then on the `Export as ZIP` button.
Extract the zip file into the repository's root directory. This zip file includes
also the updated `gis-project.grapesjs` file.

**NB:** you must clean the previous files before extract the new ones. Delete all
the `*.html` files from the repository's root directory and the two directories
`assets` and `css`.

The GrapeJS Studio can be also executed locally. Please refer to the
[GrapesJS Studio](https://grapesjs.com/docs/#quick-start) documentation.
